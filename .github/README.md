    About
</h2>
<p align="center">
<a>Daniel (Trainerlord) ~Hey Sorry I've been away for a while and neglating this plugin. However I have new Vigor and Currently planing out what I want to do with the plugin.
Right now I'm setting small goals to help improve the robustness of the plugin before I go and add any new features and you can see what I'm planing by checking the issues tab. I want to work through all the issues currently there before adding
any feature requests.<a>
<a>-Thank you.<a>

  <a>WorldSystem is a plugin where every player can get a world.</a>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a>There they can build, play and do anything they want without creating stress in a single world. The world owner can also add other players and manage their permissions on his world like is he allowed to build, teleport or changing his gamemode.</a>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <a>When a player creates a new world you can also set a template which will then be cloned.</a>

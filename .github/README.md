<h2>About</h2>
  <a>WorldSystem is a plugin where every player can get a world.</a>
  <a>There they can build, play and do anything they want without creating stress in a single world. The world owner can also add other players and manage their permissions on his world like is he allowed to build, teleport or changing his gamemode.</a></br>
  <a>When a player creates a new world you can also set a template which will then be cloned.</a>
